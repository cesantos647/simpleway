Smart cars are going to be the future of driving technology, and new systems must be created to accommodate for this technological change. SimpleWay is a decentralized traffic management system that aims to prevent autonomous car accidents. The SimpleWay method follows two principles: avoiding collision and navigation. Using Java and Processing3, we created a bare bones simulation that gives a visual representation of the SimpleWay method.
